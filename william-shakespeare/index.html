            <h3>William Shakespeare</h3>

            <p>
                William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 â€“ 23 April 1616) was an English poet, playwright and actor,
                widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's greatest dramatist. He is
                often called England's national poet and the
                "Bard of Avon". His extant works, including collaborations, consist of approximately 39 plays, 154
                sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have
                been translated into every major
                living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.

                Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne
                Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585
                and 1592, he began a successful career in London
                as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known
                as the King's Men. At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three
                years later. Few records
                of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters
                as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to
                him were written by others.
                Such theories are often criticised for failing to adequately note that few records survive of most
                commoners of the period.

                Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were primarily
                comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres. Until about
                1608, he wrote mainly tragedies, among them Hamlet,
                Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, all considered to be among the finest works in the English
                language. In the last phase of his life, he wrote tragicomedies (also known as romances) and
                collaborated with other playwrights.

                Many of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy in his lifetime.
                However, in 1623, two fellow actors and friends of Shakespeare's, John Heminges and Henry Condell,
                published a more definitive text known as the First
                Folio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare's dramatic works that included all but two of his
                plays. The volume was prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson, in which Jonson presciently hails Shakespeare
                in a now-famous quote as
                "not of an age, but for all time".
            </p>
            <p>Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, Shakespeare's works have been continually adapted and
                rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance. His plays remain popular and are studied,
                performed, and reinterpreted through
                various cultural and political contexts around the world.</p>
